We will use the Titanic Survival Dataset to build a classification model to predict whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic, based on attributes of each passenger in the dataset.
We'll start with building a Random Forest Classifier, then modify the pipeline to use a Logistic Regression estimator instead.

1. Use scikit-learn to build a model to solve a classification problem

2. Implement a pipeline to combine preprocessing steps with a machine learning model

4. Interpret the results

6. Update the pipeline with a different machine learning model

8. Compare the performances of the two classifiers
